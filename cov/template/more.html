<UL>
    <li><h4>After the new strain of Covid-19 detected in the UK, the government had imposed a ban on flights coming to India from the UK with effect from December 22 last year. However, the flight operations between India and the United Kingdom resumed from January 8. Passengers will have to undergo an RT-PCR test both in the UK before boarding their flight and after arriving in India.</h4></li>

    <li><h4>All those who have tested positive for the new variant of coronavirus are being kept in single-room isolation at designated healthcare facilities by the respective state governments, the ministry had said earlier. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine.</h4></li>
    <BR>
    <li><h4>Meanwhile, India's COVID-19 caseload rose to 1,04,50,284 with 18,645 infections being reported in a day, while the recoveries have surged to 1,00,75,950, according to the Union Health Ministry's data updated on Sunday.</h4></li>
